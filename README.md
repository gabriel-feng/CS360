Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of this app is to provide a dynamic inventory for users. The requirements of the app are to provide login, inventory, and text alert capability. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A login screen, inventory view screen, and profile setting screen were included and designed to aid users in accessing the functionalities built around the requirements.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the development of my app with object oriented principles.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

As I could not properly run my application on the API emulator, I could not effectively test my application. However, the best I could do was ensure my code quality.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to be innovative in my approach to the code design as I could not effectively test the code.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I don't believe I was particularly successful in any part of this application, but I think trying to overcome the difficulty of not being able to test my application by running through how the program would run in my mind was a good exercise.
